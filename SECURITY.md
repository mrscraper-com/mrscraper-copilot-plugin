# Security Policy

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately to
[support@mrscraper.com](mailto:support@mrscraper.com). Include the affected
component, reproduction steps, and potential impact. Do not open a public issue
for an unpatched vulnerability or include credentials, tokens, customer data,
or private target content in a report.

This repository contains no MrScraper credentials and no executable code that
runs on your machine: the plugin is a manifest, an MCP server URL, and skill
instructions. Authentication is handled by GitHub Copilot CLI's OAuth 2.1 MCP
connection, which stores and refreshes the tokens. If you use the API key
fallback, the key stays in your own `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` and carries
full account authority. If a credential may have been exposed, revoke it
through the relevant account or client immediately and then contact support.
